Excecutive Summary:
As the PTSD data scientist we have been tasked to analyze and predict the average temperature from the agri-food sector, using the data received from FAO and IPCC. The dataset comprises of about 30 features and +7000 records.
While analyzing the data given, one feature being countries we have chosen to work with the dataset from South Africa. The country as we know it has diverse demographics, a resource-rich country and an attractive tourism industry.

Problem Statement: To analyze and develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the average temperature for South Africa over 1990 to 2020 based on the manure management, years, urban population and total emission. In order to determine the impact of food production.

How we determined the features we will be using was how relevant each dataset to South Africas climate. We created pair plots so our decision on the features  can be determined using the given data and usable for the predictive model. Forest fires was one of our consideration but on the pair plot against average temperature data was not showing any relevance.

While doing some analysis on the chosen features we need to check for multicollinearity. This arises when at least two or more independent variables in a model are highly correlated, indicating a strong linear relationship among the predictor variables. We will use the Ordinary Least Squares summary as it can provide insight on potential errors, model evaluation, coefficient interpretation and potential model improvement. This gives a deeper underlying relationships between variables.

Below is the advantages
1. Mulitiple Linear Regression - relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables
2. Ridge Regression - regularization technique used to address the issue of multicollinearity in linear regression models
3. Decision Tree Model - represent data by partitioning it into different sections based on questions asked of predictive variables in the data.
